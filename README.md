# Reddit Post Reader and Photowall Slideshow

I built this App to improve my React/Redux skills...

Search for any Subreddit and read the posts and/or view a photowall constructed from all the photos in the posts in that Subreddit.

View it live on the wab at [http://subreddit-reader.surge.sh/](http://subreddit-reader.surge.sh/)

It uses the old 'Read Only' Reddit API... See: [https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON)
